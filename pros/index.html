      <p>The use of nuclear power to power our houses has long been discussed by many citizens. Nuclear power can be harmful if radioactive materials get released into the air like in the Chernobyl Accident of 1986 or the accident at Three Mile Island. These materials can cause serious harm to living species. There were even two-headed pigs that were discovered in radioactively contaminated areas. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused many countries’ energy supplies to become scarce, which has caused many power failures. This has become an issue, and some countries have started to use nuclear power fully. Today, how to power the population of 8 billion has become a major issue around the world.</p>
<p>Nuclear power can sometimes be very harmful, including incidents or accidents leaving inhabitable zones. However, modern technology has proved that these plants can operate well under normal conditions. Major accidents due to technical flaws like Three Mile Island and Chernobyl happened in the 20th Century, and the Fukushima Daiichi accident, which happened in the 21st Century, happened due to a tsunami caused by an earthquake. In addition, nuclear power is not the only harmful energy farming method. Fossil fuels, still used as primary energy sources in many countries, can cause major accidents. In fact, Ewan Mcleish mentions in his book that “All methods of generation, including nuclear energy, are potentially damaging.” There is no reason for people to think nuclear power is especially harmful.</p>
        <p>Some people may argue that nuclear waste can still cause a major problem to do with nuclear power. However, I disagree. Today, when energy is like diamonds, nuclear power is necessary for people to continue their lives. Nuclear power can even replace fossil fuels. According to Ewan Mcleish, by using nuclear power instead of fossil fuels, “We could possibly halt the effects of global warming on a significant scale”.</p>
