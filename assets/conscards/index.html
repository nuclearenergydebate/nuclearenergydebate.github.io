        <h5 class="card-title">Nuclear Power</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The use of nuclear power to power our houses has long been discussed by many citizens. Nuclear power can provide immense amounts of energy every day unlike solar power or wind power. It can also be air-friendly, without releasing carbon dioxide into the air unlike fossil fuels like oil. This is very important to improve conditions of global warming. Until when serious accidents happened. Once, it was considered that humans could handle even the worst-case scenarios of a nuclear accident. Today, after many disasterous accidents, people are still looking forward to use nuclear power.

        <h5 class="card-title">Nuclear Accidents</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Nuclear power can provide energy 24/7 without any breaks. This allows it to produce immense amounts of energy all the time. As fossil fuels destroy the environment, nuclear energy has been considered a very clean type of energy. However, it is clear that there are many flaws to nuclear energy. In other words, accidents haev proved that nuclear energy cannot be operated properly under situations such as electrical outage or a natural disaster. In fact, Deirdre S. Blanchfield states in his article “Nuclear power” that many accidents have happened before due to flaws in its design. <mark>Everyone can agree that nuclear power is dangerous.</mark>

        <h5 class="card-title">Nuclear Wastes</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Even if these accidents did not happen, there is one more problem for nuclear power. This is the problem for nuclear wastes or radioactive wastes. Nuclear pellets, which are used to get the energy in nuclear reactors, have to be removed someday because they have been so contaminated and cannot be used again in a reactor. There is currently no way to fix this, and these radioactive wastes can cause harm to teh environment and humans. These problems do not happen in solar energy or wind energy, which are considered a “clean energy”. Although someone might argue that nuclear power is needed to continue our daily lives, nuclear power can be easily replaced with immense amounts of other renewable energy types. Nuclear energy is too harmful to be in our daily lives. <mark>We don't want our homes destroyed like the California Wildfire!</mark>

        <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Although nuclear power is not absolutely safe, it can provide energy 24/7, and maybe even bring cleaner air, if fossil fuels are replaced with nuclear power. This could definitely have a strong impact on global warming. Nuclear power is necessary to keep our home lit up and well, and it can bring electricity to many homes that do not have electricity.
