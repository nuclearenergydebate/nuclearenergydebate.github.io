        <h5 class="card-title">Nuclear Power</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The use of nuclear power to power our houses has long been discussed by many citizens. Nuclear power can provide immense amounts of energy every day unlike solar power or wind power. It can also be air-friendly, without releasing carbon dioxide into the air, unlike fossil fuels like oil. This is very important to improve conditions of global warming. Until when serious accidents happened. Once, it was considered that humans could handle even the worst-case scenarios of a nuclear accident. Today, after many disastrous accidents, people are still looking forward to using nuclear power.

        <h5 class="card-title">Nuclear Accidents</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Nuclear power can provide energy 24/7 without any breaks. This allows it to produce immense amounts of energy all the time. As fossil fuels destroy the environment, nuclear energy has been considered a very clean type of energy. However, there are many flaws in nuclear energy. In other words, accidents have proved that nuclear energy cannot be operated properly under situations such as electrical outages or natural disasters. In fact, Deirdre S. Blanchfield states in his article “Nuclear power” that many accidents have happened before due to flaws in its design. <mark>Everyone can agree that nuclear power is dangerous.</mark>

        <h5 class="card-title">Radioactive Waste</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Even if these accidents did not happen, there is one more problem for nuclear power. This is the problem for nuclear waste or radioactive waste. Nuclear pellets, which are used to get the energy in nuclear reactors, have to be removed someday because they have been so contaminated and cannot be used again in a reactor. There is currently no way to fix this, and these radioactive wastes can cause harm to the environment and humans. These problems do not happen in solar energy or wind energy, which are considered a “clean energy”. Although someone might argue that nuclear power is needed to continue our daily lives, nuclear power can be easily replaced with immense amounts of other renewable energy types. Nuclear energy is too harmful to be in our daily lives. <mark>Radioactive wastes are grizzly bears.</mark>

        <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Although nuclear power can provide energy constantly, it can harm animals and humans at a significant scale, and maybe even destroy the environment. Radioactive wastes can cause more problems, with no way to get rid of them. Nuclear power definitely has a huge impact on our environment, and to save our lives and our planet, nuclear power must not be used.
